A small description about my project :
Quiz Application Using Aptos (QAUA) is the topic of my project. QAUA is an interactive quiz platform where users can earn Aptos tokens by giving correct answers in their quiz. Each correct answer will lead to an increase in their aptos tokens by a factor of 2 i.e. a person will be rewarded 2 aptos tokens for each of his/her correct answer in the quiz. Players can view their results and leaderboard due to which they can see how they rank among others. This project merges knowledge and blockchain rewards in a very exciting way.
